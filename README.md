### Summary
---
The book went into great detail regarding AngularJS' core functionality with directives. BUT... older versions. I would have been better served if I used the 1.0.x version Alex used in the book :boom:...

I did not get very far with the later part of the book RE: testing. To many battles getting things setup.
